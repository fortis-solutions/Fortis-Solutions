# Suki Kesington’s IT & Cybersecurity Lab Portfolio 🔐

Welcome to my project repo.

I’m building real, hands-on cybersecurity skills the practical way: spin up labs, break things (safely), fix them, then document everything so someone else can reproduce it. Most of my work is focused on vulnerability management, hardening, and “why isn’t this scan working?” troubleshooting across Windows/Linux and Azure-style environments.

If you’re a recruiter, hiring manager, or just curious — feel free to click around. Everything here is built to reflect what I’d do in a real environment: clear steps, evidence, and honest notes on what went wrong + how I solved it.
